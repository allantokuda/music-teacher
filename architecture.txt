Components:
- detector: process FFT data to detect notes being struck
- quizzer: game that present a sequence of notes/chords to the user. As the correct notes are detected, proceed to the next.
- composer: choose a sequence of notes to present to the user. Use historical data to predict the best notes to quiz. Similar to Anki.
- logger: record everything that occurred in context so the composer can adapt
- syllabus: a list of progressively difficult concepts to guide what the composer focuses on. For example it should start with C/G/F chords rather than jumping right into G#.

Development plan:
- get detector to a B grade of accuracy so it begins to be useful
- write a basic composer that chooses randomly from a subset of hard coded notes/chords
- write a quizzer game using the above
- iterate on the detector to improve accuracy and feel of the game
